### SS58 Example

*NOTE:* `CommonSwift` library can be found [here](https://github.com/sublabdev/common-swift).
The `hex` extension for `String` is defined in `CommonSwift` library.

```Swift
import HashingSwift
import CommonSwift

let value = "J3f13B92p6aMcoHxfjz4VyDRhtQt23SgzZy5NfTz3fz2wvR"
let publicKey = try value.ss58.publicKey()
```
In the above code snippet is shown the process of generating `public` key using `SS58` hashing mechanism.
The `public` key for the provided `value` equals to `"0xf206618f046df7204d07788a8449d7eb08811b44cdf51afde3efd4c4fcd4dd6e".hex.decode()`
.

Also, we can get `address` using the provided `value`.

```Swift
let networkType = try value.ss58.networkType()
let address = try publicKey.ss58.address(type: networkType)
```
First, we get the `network type` after which we use it to generate the address for the `public` key, found earlier.
The `address` equals to the initial `value`.

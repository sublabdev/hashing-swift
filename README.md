# Sublab's Hashing Swift library

This is a Swift repository which shares hashing implementations of different algorithms used in Substrate ecosystem.

When we add support for new Substrate networks which introduce new hashing algorithm, its implementation should be put here.

Currently, all hashing algorithms are borrowed from other libraries, and all of them proxied with standard single interface for easier Substrate development.

## Sublab

At Sublab we're making mobile-first libraries for developers in [Substrate](https://substrate.io) ecosystem. However, we seek our libraries to be available not only for mobile Apple OS or Android OS, but compatible with any Swift/Kotlin environment: web servers, desktop apps, and whatnot.

Our mission is to to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. 

Our goal is to have more developers to come into the world of development of client applications in Substrate ecosystem, as we find this as most promising and intelligent blockchain project we ever seen. Thus, we as mobile development gurus trying to create enormously professional libraries which might be very complicated under the hood, but very simple and convenient for final developers.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'HashingSwift'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding HashingSwift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/sublabdev/hashing-swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
```
